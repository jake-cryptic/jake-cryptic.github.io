						busy parts of Cardiff because these are good for locals who just need the essentials. Suburban shopping streets are spread over Cardiff because these have better
						access as you don't have to go into the middle of the city where it's busy and there is a lot of traffic.

					</span>
					<p class="csd">
						Cardiff Bay, located in the South of Wales, has seen an urban change.<br /><br />
						The area has changed because is used to be a large port and had a good source of coal and iron ore. There was also a site of ironworks and steelworks.
						The docks imported tin and palm oil. They exported coal, iron, tin plate and steel. In 1913, Cardiff docks went into decline because other countries developed their own
						resources and they began to run out of iron ore and coal.<br />In 1987 change began with the formation of the <abbr title="Cardiff Bay Development Corp.">CBDC (Cardiff Bay Development Corp.)</abbr>
						They added restaurants, modern buildings and introduced the Red Dragon Centre where there is a cinema and bowling alley. They also build the 'Cardiff Bay Barrage' across the Cardiff Bay,
						allowing it to fill up with water, this created a giant freshwater lake for watersports, before this, that area had been saltwater mudflats with water only occupying the bay 14 hours a day.
						By building the barrage, Cardiff bay can now be classed as 'seaside'; allowing for construction of high quality (and higher priced) housing.<br /><br />
						Although all of these developments seem good, many have been against it, such as the <abbr title="Royal Society for the Protection of Birds">RSPB</abbr> because the birds feed on the mudflats
						and so wouldn't have anywhere to go when the mudflats go. Also, some locals were against it because there would be an increased risk of floods as ground water could rise by 3m. On the other hand,
						business men will be for the plan because they can create a business in Cardiff Bay and earn lots of money due to the bay being popular and attracting many tourists who will spend money there.
						Also, future tourists will be for the plan because it makes the area look more attractive and it will also have more shopping facilities and places to eat.

					<p class="csd">
						Cwrt-Y-Gollen is a former Military Base located just South of Crickhowell, in Wales, UK.<br /><br />
						The plans for Cwrt-Y-Gollen involved the building of around 200 houses, but when this was rejected they changed the plans to 70 houses instead. 
						There were also plans for many services, including a small business district with offices and other commercial units. The development hoped to have a Gym,
						built in the old Gym building, an old peoples home and a nursery. Plans also included those for new tennis courts.<br /><br />
						The local Tennis club is very happy for the development, as they have receive heavy pressure on their small club and have a very long membership waiting list. Another local group who would 
						be very happy with the new development is Crickhowell High School, which will receive more funding with an influx in new students brought by the new residents of the Cwrt-Y-Gollen development.
						A party that would not be happy with the new development are the local commuters, as they will face increases in traffic on the A40, with cars and other transport exiting from the development which is 
						on the side of the main road. Another party that would be unhappy are the local environmental groups. They are not happy about the disruptive building equipment and vast increase in local CO2 emissions
						that would emerge from such a development, although the development is taking place on a brownfield site and so is more environmentally friendly than if it were to be built
						on a greenfield site, this also means that the site has infastructure such as electrical cables and water pipes. An alternative unhappy party would be the local dog walkers, who would lose access to a very good public park.

						were washed away. <br /><br />
						The natural causes include an extremely high amount of rainfall over the drainage basin - 200mm in one day. Also, the two rivers join in Boscastle
						which gives double the flow of water through the harbour. As the rocks of the drainage basin are impermeable slates, and thin clay soils, they do not
						allow rainwater to infiltrate the ground. Also, it was high tide at the same time as the flash flood, the river water was dammed back adding to the flooding
						of the town. The human causes include Boscastle being build near the harbour because this is where the tourists businesses are located. Also, some of the
						bridges became blocked with debris and dammed back with flood water.

						it is expensive to construct and maintain. However, this is an advantage to land owners because they would be paid compensation. Also, planting trees on steep slopes is a
						disadvantage because is replaces high biodiversity habitats with lower. However, local residents would be for it because it makes the landscape look nicer. Also, not building
						on the lower flood plain by the harbour there would be less room for shops and housing. However the <abbr title="Royal Society for the Protection of Birds">RSPB</abbr> would

						The Holderness Coast is located on the East coast of England. It extends 61km from Flamborough in the North to Spurn Point in the South.<br /><br />
						The Holderness Coastline is one of Europe's fastest eroding coastlines with an average annual rate of erosion at around 2 meters per year.
						Underlying the Holderness coastline is bedrock made of Cretaceous chalk. The Holderness coastline is subject to coastal erosion and depositation e.g Flamborough has 
						coastal erosion which leads to the formation of caves, arches and stacks. Finally, Spurn Point is a result of longshort drift on the Holderness coast and is
						an excellent example of a split, around 3% of the material eroded from the Holderness coast is deposited here each year!<br /><br />
						The Holderness Coastline is used for housing, especially in the village of Mappleton perched on a cliff top which measures approximately 50 properties.
						The Holderness Coast also contains the Easington gas terminal which supplies 25% of Britain's gas. It is also used as a nature reserve as Spurn Point as aquatic wildlife
						can easily be preserved there as well as unique habitats due to the defences which are in place. Finally the surroundng land is great for agriculture due to highly
						fertile soil which is caused by mineral deposits by the sea.

						Hurricane Katrina on the East Coast of the USA, specifically New Orleans.<br /><br />
						The hurricane started forming in the North Atlantic Ocean when sea surface temperature rose to 27<sup>o</sup>C and above. Strong winds of 70mph blew the water in-land,
						creating a surge wave. This is whipped into a hurricane as the wind speed increases and the event gathers momentum. It reached Florida with wind speeds of 220mph at the
						eye of the hurricane and was a Category 4 storm.<br /><br />
						It left 100,000 homes without power. Those with cars or who were able to book flights were able to travel to safety, but many airports were closed and flights were
						cancelled. This led to many thousands of people stranded. Those who were unable to leave because they could afford to had their homes destroyed and their possessions
						left to the storm. 20,000 of these people hid in the superdome which became unsafe very quickly. The government had to airlift people out, costing millions.
						Many businesses were also destroyed, which negatively impacted the economy. Flood defences broke which later had to be repaired costing the government many millions
						of dollars more. 1836 people died and 80% of the city was flooded, resulting in the destruction of many buildings and a large amount of infastructure.

					<p class="csd">
						The Amazon rainforest is located in South America. <br /><br />
						The climate of the Amazon rainforest is humid; generally hot with an average rainfall of 335mm per annum, and a temperature range between 25-28C. The climate consists
						of different layers of evergreen trees, rivers as well as a wide range of animal and plant species.<br /><br />
						Most of the trees in the area are being cut down due to the demand for wood and other products such as palm oil.<br /><br />
						Over the last three decades, trees have been cut down for various reason. The forest provides habitats for many people and animals. A way that the climate has affected
						people is due to deforestation, which has meant that land is worth more and more likely to be sold for industrial purposes, such as gold mining. Many tribes are dying
						particularly from disease that they were not subjected to before other people entered the forest. This has led to a decrease in tribe population from 8 million to 200,000<br /><br />
						The tropical weather here means that farmers can grow crops all year long. Due to the high volume of trees, a small number of trees can be cut down without damaging the 
						environment too much. Large corperations are able to use large areas of rainforest for farming animals and for gold mining. When the trees are cut down, the oil from the
						trees that replace them (fast growing palm trees) can be used in soaps and oven chips. The sap from rainforest trees can also be used to make rubber, meaning companies 
						create a higher profit margin by being able to sell more product.

					<p class="csd">
						There are some differing views about how climate change should be managed. For instance some people believe that Climate change is not a result of human intervention and the industrial revolution.
						They believe that it's a natural cycle that occurs on Earth and that we cannot affect it in any way and should therefore not bother with management. <s>There are some who believe that it's a hoax by
						the Chinese to steal American jobs.</s> Some think that Eco energy (e.g Solar Panels, Wind farms and Hydro-Electric power) is too costly to utilise, compared to non-renewable sources such as coal and gas.
						However, others think that us humans caused a massive increase in <abbr title="Carbon Dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> in the atmosphere and so therefore should do everything possible to manage climate change,
						e.g. Renewable energy sources, recyling materials, use of public transport over a car.<br /><br />
						Attempts to manage climate change at a local scale are numerous, even our school has done it. Ways of managing climate change include installation of solar panels to decrease reliance on fossil fuel
						generated energy. There is also increased wall/roof/window insulation which keeps heat inside, reducing energy loss, which in turn, reduces your <abbr title="Carbon Dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> footprint.
						There is also encouragement to use public transport like buses or trains, instead of relying on cars for transport over long distances, over shorter distances you could just walk.

						The Katse Dam is located in Lesotho in Africa.<br><br />
						The issue is that South Africa<em>(country not area of Africa)</em>, northern Africa and the Middle East lack freshwater supplies and rely on nearby countries to supply water. Lesotho is providing South Africa
						with water, which accounts for 75% of the country's income. The water is needed because the average American family uses 1304 litres of water every day, compared to 22 litres for the average African family.
						The problem is that water extraction is very expensive and LEDCs in Africa are less likely to be able to afford this.<br /><br />
						Lesotho are for the development because it generates income for the country. However, those who were displaced by the creation of the dam were not given compensation. They were given training bu this was 
						ineffective as many of the displace people are still in low-income jobs<br /><br />
						However, the dam has created 20,000 jobs. Yet, this influx of people to the area has led to an increase in prostitution, AIDS and alcoholism.
