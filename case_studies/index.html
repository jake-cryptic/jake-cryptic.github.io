						Cardiff is the capital city of Wales, and is located in the South West of Wales.<br /><br />
						Shopping services are distributed in the <abbr title="Central Business District">CBD</abbr> in a linear fashion because this is a pedestrianised area, so people
						can shop freely without having to worry about their safety. Shops in retail parks are found randomly around the outskirts of Cardiff because, particularly by major
						main roads such as the M4 and A48 because they are accessible for lots of people as they are on main roads and roundabouts. Corner shops are found randomly in the less
						busy parts of Cardiff because these are good for locals who just need the essentials. Suburban shopping streets are spread over Cardiff because these have better
						access as you don't have to go into the middle of the city where it's busy and there is a lot of traffic.

						3. Explain why different groups of people have a range of views on the changes.<br />
					</span>
					<p class="csd">
						Cardiff Bay, located in the South of Wales, has seen an urban change.<br /><br />
						The area has changed because is used to be a large port and had a good source of coal and iron ore. There was also a site of ironworks and steelworks.
						The docks imported tin and palm oil. They exported coal, iron, tin plate and steel. In 1913, Cardiff docks went into decline because other countries developed their own
						resources and they began to run out of iron ore and coal.<br />In 1987 change began with the formation of the <abbr title="Cardiff Bay Development Corp.">CBDC (Cardiff Bay Development Corp.)</abbr>
						They added restaurants, modern buildings and introduced the Red Dragon Centre where there is a cinema and bowling alley. They also build the 'Cardiff Bay Barrage' across the Cardiff Bay,
						allowing it to fill up with water, this created a giant freshwater lake for watersports, before this, that area had been saltwater mudflats with water only occupying the bay 14 hours a day.
						By building the barrage, Cardiff bay can now be classed as 'seaside'; allowing for construction of high quality (and higher priced) housing.<br /><br />
						Although all of these developments seem good, many have been against it, such as the <abbr title="Royal Society for the Protection of Birds">RSPB</abbr> because the birds feed on the mudflats
						and so wouldn't have anywhere to go when the mudflats go. Also, some locals were against it because there would be an increased risk of floods as ground water could rise by 3m. On the other hand,
						business men will be for the plan because they can create a business in Cadiff Bay and earn lots of money due to the bay being popular and attracting many tourists who will spend money there.
						Also, future tourists will be for the plan because it makes the area look more attractive and it will also have more shopping facilities and places to eat.

					</span>
					<p class="csd">
						Rural to urban migration is happening in Sao Paulo, which is located on the South East coast of Brazil.<br /><br />People moved away from the countryside because they had droughts and therefore the
						wells ran dry and crops failed, so farmers had less stock to sell which lead to food shortages. Also they have less services in the countryside such as doctors and chemists. Villages have few
						schools and houses often have no electricity, water or sanitation. Also, the majority of jobs involve farming paying low wages.<br />Pull factors to the city include a wide range of jobs
						with good salaries, more infastructure and housing with electricity, a water supply and sanitaion.<br /><br />
						An increased amount of people in the city means that there are not enough jobs for everyone, so crime and unemployment rise. Also, diseases spread quickly due to contaminated drinking water and
						the fact there are not enough doctors. There are also not enough schools for the thousands of people arriving in the city. Land slides can also occur due to the favella's, which are illegal houses
						that have been poorly built on steep slopes due to the lack of decent housing in the area, an example of this is in Rio.

						<span class="m">Boscastle is located on the north coast of Cornwall, 30km North West of Plymouth.</span><br /><br />
						Disadvantages of the flood prevention scheme include the river channel being straightened and then lining it with concerete because it is expensive because it is expensive
						and stops the natural flow of the river. Local residents would not like this because their homes would have to be relocated. Also, building a dam in the upper valley because 
						it is expensive to construct and maintain. However, this is an advantage to land owners because they would be paid conpensation. Also, planting trees on steep slopes is a
						disadvantage because is replaces high biodiversity habitats with lower. However, local residents would be for it because it makes the landscape look nicer. Also, not building
						on the lower flood plain by the harbour there would be less room for shops and housing. However the <abbr title="Royal Society for the Protection of Birds">RSPB</abbr> would 
						be for it because building destroys destroys habitats and therefore the number of birds living in the area would decrease.

					<p class="csd">
						The Holderness Coast is located on the East coast of England. It extends 61km from Flamborough in the North to Spurn Point in the South.<br /><br />
						The Holderness Coastline is one of Europe's fastest eroding coastlines with an average annual rate of erosion at around 2 meters per year.
						Underlying the Holderness coastline is bedrock made of Cretaceous chalk. The Holderness coastline is subject to coastal erosion and depositation e.g Flamborough has 
						coastal erosion which leads to the formation of caves, arches and stacks. Finally, Spurn Point is a result of longshort drift on the Holderness coast and is
						an excellent example of a split, around 3% of the material eroded from the Holderness coast is deposited here each year!<br /><br />
						The Holderness Coastline is used for housing, especially in the village of Mappleton perched on a cliff top which measures approximately 50 properties.
						The Holderness Coast also contains the Easington gas terminal which supplies 25% of Britain's gas. It is also used as a nature reserve as Spurn Point as aquatic wildlife
						can easily be preserved there as well as unique habitats due to the defences which are in place. Finally the surroundng land is great for agriculture due to highly
						fertile soil which is caused by mineral deposits by the sea.

					</span>
					<p class="csd">
						There are some differing views about how climate change should be managed. For instance some people believe that Climate change is not a result of human intervention and the industrial revolution.
						They believe that it's a natural cycle that occurs on Earth and that we cannot affect it in any way and should therefore not bother with management. <s>There are some who believe that it's a hoax by
						the Chinese to steal American jobs.</s> Some think that Eco energy (e.g Solar Panels, Wind farms and Hydro-Electric power) is too costly to utilise, compared to non-renewable sources such as coal and gas.
						However, others think that us humans caused a massive increase in <abbr title="Carbon Dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> in the atmosphere and so therefore should do everything possible to manage climate change,
						e.g. Renewable energy sources, recyling materials, use of public transport over a car.<br /><br />
						Attempts to manage climate change at a local scale are numerous, even our school has done it. Ways of managing climate change include installation of solar panels to decrease reliance on fossil fuel
						generated energy. There is also increased wall/roof/window insulation which keeps heat inside, reducing energy loss, which in turn, reduces your <abbr title="Carbon Dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> footprint.
						There is also encouragement to use public transport like buses or trains, instead of relying on cars for transport over long distances, over shorter distances you could just walk.
